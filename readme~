Advanced GCM notifies the registered Mobile Device Users, whenever the post is published or edited.

== Description ==

Advanced GCM gives a notification to the registered mobile device users of the website on their Mobile Devices whenever the post is published or updated. On an android application , Users will get the Tech news and updates of the website.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin through wordpress.org/plugins

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

3. After that go to Settings -> Advanced-GCM. 

4. Provide Google API Key to the Google API Textbox. You can have it from your Google API Console. After that generate the security key by clicking on Generate key. As soon as you generate the key and save the changes then the textbox will get replaced with label having value of the key you have generated. 

5. After that on the other side , an Android application will be there to get the notification and display the post. whenever users install the application , the device ID will be generated and an encrypted key will also be generated. one gnerated security key from the Settings->Advanced GCM page is already stored in android app. using that key and device id that the application has generated , the generated encrypted key is passed along with device ID. And from the plugin side , there will also be an encrypted key using device ID which is being sent by the application and the security key which user has generated. This encrypted key and another encrypted key generated by the application will be taken to match. If they both match then only that device id will get registered , otherwise it will not be registered.

6. After registered the device ID , whenever the post is published or edited then the particular post will be notified to the user through the application on registered mobile devices.

7. If you don't want to notify to the users for particular post then there is a check box called "Don't send Notification". If you check on it and then publish or update the post then no users will get notified for the same post.

== Other Notes ==

1. To register your Mobile Device , you have to go to 
	http://yourwebsite/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?device_id=[device_id]&user_id=[user_id]&security_key=[security_key]&action=[action_name]
        where,	[device_id] = your device_id(required)
		[user_id] = user_id (optional)
		[security_key] = Your security key(required) . This is the key which is generated with sh1 encryption algorithm. 
		It is a combination of device id which the application has generated and the security key which the application does have 			already before.  
		[action_name] = ag_add_device (required)	

2.Here, user_id is optional. So if you don't provide it then default users of your website will be taken in consideration.
3. There is also an encryption of sh1 using device id which is passed by an application to the website and a security key which the user has generated in Settings -> Advanced-GCM. Using these , an encrypted key will be generated and that particular encrypted key will be taken to match with the security key which the application has passed. If these two encrypted keys match , then only you will get a message of "success(true)" , which means that your device id is registered in website, otherwise you will have the message "success(false)".
